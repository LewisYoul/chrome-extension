# Word Definition

This is a chrome extension that allows you to highlight a word on any web page and obtain its definition(s) from the Oxford Dictionary.

It is still a work in progress.

## Set Up

* Clone this repo
* Load up chrome and visit `chrome://extensions/`
* Select 'Load unpacked extension...' and navigate to the directory to which you cloned.
* Once you have loaded the extension an icon should appear in the top right of chrome.
* Load a new page and highlight a word - assuming it is a real English word the definition will appear in the bottom right of the page in a light blue box.
